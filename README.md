# CinemaBookingTicket

This repository contains the source code for the CinemaBookingTicket project.

## Branch policy

The `main` branch is protected from direct pushes. All changes must be submitted through a pull request.

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/require-pull-request.yml`) enforces this rule by failing if a commit is pushed directly to `main` without going through a pull request.

To collaborate, create a feature branch and open a pull request targeting `main`.
